TODO: write rotten->{clojure,scheme,racket} compiler in rotten

It actually doesn't matter much how difficult it is to implement rotten in
clojure/racket.

It matters how difficult it is to implement rotten in rotten.

So I should start by thinking about the semantics of rotten, and a mock
rotten-in-rotten implementation.

* metacircularly evaluate rotten
* compile rotten to clojure
* compile rotten to racket
