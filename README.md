This project is an exercise in golfing. Therefore, everything in it is horribly,
horribly bad, including but not limited to:

- the language design
- the VM design
- the interpreter implementation
- the VM implementation

Do **not** take any of these as an example of how to do it. If you'd like
pointers on slightly more reasonable ways to design and implement a lisp, feel
free to [email me](mailto:daekharel@gmail.com), although I am not an expert.
