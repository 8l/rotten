* Intro
Over the last two weeks, I've written a compiler for a tiny lisp language I call
Rotten.

The way Rotten works is:
1. Rotten compiles to code for a simple VM
2. The VM itself is implemented in Racket (racket-lang.org)

The first interesting thing about Rotten is that:
the compiler from Rotten to VM-code is written in Rotten!

The second interesting thing about Rotten is how small it is:
- compiler:  80 LOC
-       VM: 130 LOC
-  REPL &c:  90 LOC
TOTAL:    < 300 LOC!

* Demo
But that's not what I'm here to talk about.
I'm here to talk about a virus in my compiler!

* REPL session
<driver.rkt> (boot)
;; the virtual machine has just booted up
;; and loaded a precompiled image of the compiler

<driver.rkt> (repl)
;; Now we're running Rotten code!

ROTTEN> (+ 2 2)
ROTTEN> '(hello from rotten lisp)
ROTTEN> (def (double x) (+ x x))
ROTTEN> (double 10)
ROTTEN> (compile-exp '(+ 2 2)) ;; the compiler is available at runtime
