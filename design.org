* Design notes
(car '()) = (cdr '()) = '()
(symbol? '()) = '()
(atom? x) = (not (cons? x))

specials: quote fn if
builtins: cons car cdr symbol? atom? cons? eq? apply

* design questions
** recursive VM?
should I drop the whole continuation thing, and just have the VM recursively
call itself? this would simplify 'apply as well.

OTOH, it makes it feel less like a "real" virtual machine, where recursively
calling the VM is generally considered bad. (why is it bad again? I guess if you
need to do control stack manipulation...)

OTOH, it doesn't shop up in the *interface* to the VM, which is what I care
about most.
